As a fresh start, I will include a path to resources that I experienced and helped me earn AZ-900, DP-900, AI-900, PL-900 & SC-900 respectively Azure, Data, Artificial Intelligence, Power Platform & Microsoft Security, Compliance and Identity Fundamentals.

Following the same rhythm with increasing effort, I was able to get certified as an **Azure Developer, Administrator, Security Engineer & DevOps Engineer Expert.**

Microsoft fundamentals are designed to ensure that you have a good foundation on the skills that are measured in the exam & being able to describe them.

For someone new to the cloud, it is challenging to choose the right material.

###  0. Microsoft Technical Documentation
